## Introduction

EmbedJs Chat Bot Template is an open-source AI chatbot that uses [EmbedJs](https://github.com/llmembed/embedjs) and OpenAI to to interact in natural language on specific topics. As a demo, the bot is set to answer questions about Steve Jobs but you can load your own dataset.

For example, you can create a Harry Potter chat bot or a bot that answers questions about your private data pretty easily by simply changing a few configurations.
